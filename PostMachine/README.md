The theoretical post machine, thought up by American mathematician Emil Post, can compute anything a modern computer can.
It consists of 4 parts: Program memory, processor, processing "tape", and a processor. The processing tape contains one
instruction per line in the form <state><char><new state><string> where the states are a single character and a string can
contain 0 or more alpha characters.
